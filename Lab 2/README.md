## Question 1
- _ros_cs.m_ is a matlab function that computs N, ROC, C, S
- _q1.m_ Outputs N, ROC, C , S for different values of p

## Question 2
- _q2_a.m_ Pole zero plot p = 0.8
- _q2_b.m_ DTFT of the filter. Plots the magnitude response of the filter (p= 0.8)
- _q2_c.m_ plots impulse response of the filter(p = 0.8)
- _q2_d.m_ Pole-Zero plot, Magnitude response and impulse response for p = -0.8 and p = 0.1
- _q2_e.m_ Pole-Zero plot, Magnitude response and impulse response for a different system function with pole at p = 0.5

## Question 3
- _q3_a.m_ Pole-Zero plots for the transfer function with varying theta and r values.
- _q3_c.m_ Pole-Zero plots with r = 0.95 while varying theta
- _q3_d.m_ Pole-Zero plots with theta = 60 while varying r

## Question 4
- _q4_a.m_ Plots magnitude for the Frequency response of the transfer function
- _q4_b.m_ Pole-Zero plot for the transfer function
