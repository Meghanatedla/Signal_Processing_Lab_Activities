## Question 1
- _MAsystem.m_ is a function that implements an MA system
- _q1_b.m_ tests the MA system with unit step function as input
- _q1_c.m_ finds the trends of the given test sequence s1[n] provided in q1.mat file and plots the output signal when s1[n] is given as input to the MA system
- _q1_1.m_ finds the impulse response of the mA system and implements using convoution.

## Question 2
- _q2_a.m_ plots upsampling for a ramp signal using zero order hold and linear interpolation for M = 2, 3
- _q2_b_1.m_ plots upsampling for signal given in q2_1.mat using zero order hold and linear interpolation for M = 2, 3
- _q2_b_2.m_ plots upsampling for signal given in q2_2.mat using zero order hold and linear interpolation for M = 2, 3

## Question 3
- _q3_a.m_ implements an AM system
- _q3_c.m_ plots the poles and zeros of the system

## Question 4
- _q4_a.m_ plots the poles and zeros of H(z)
- _q4_b.m_ find the impulse response x[n] by finding inverse of this z-transform
